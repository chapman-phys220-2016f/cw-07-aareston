# PHYS220 CW 7

**Author(s):** Aaron Grisez and Preston Kamada

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-07-aareston.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-07-aareston)

**Due date:** 2016/10/18

## Specification

**Reminder: We have switched to Python3 officially.**

Complete the following exercises from the primary textbook, placing your solutions into separate files. In each file, write the solution as a callable function, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

1. p.683, C.1, in ```nonhomogeneous_linear_ODE.py```
1. p.683, C.2, in ```nonlinear_ODE.py```

To cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```cw7-odes.ipynb``` that imports each file and carefully discusses your answers to each question. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section. 

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

Good assignment, really liked having to delve so deeply into what it means to solve an ODE, I feel like I have a much better knowledge of what ODEs can represent.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

Aaron Grisez
